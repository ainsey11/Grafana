The project will collect data for the following services / statistics:

-Server Online / Offline
-Number of online servers
-Number of online clients
-Exchange E-mails sent
-Exchange E-mails recieved
-Exchange RAM Usage
-Exchange CPU Usage
-Exchange Datastore Usage
-Running Backup Jobs

-Recent alerts? 

Some of this data will be collected via Powershell scripts. These scripts will
be installed on THQ-MAN01 and ran by scheduled tasks under the "Rob" folder.

All e-mail alerts relating to this wallboard and scripts will be sent to:
robert.ainsworth@timico.co.uk

To set up:

- Install Grafana-Server
	 wget https://grafanarel.s3.amazonaws.com/builds/grafana_2.1.3_amd64.deb
	 sudo apt-get install -y adduser libfontconfig
	 sudo dpkg -i grafana_2.1.3_amd64.deb

	Add to /etc/apt/sources.list :
	deb https://packagecloud.io/grafana/stable/debian/ wheezy main

	then:
	curl https://packagecloud.io/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install grafana

- Start Grafana Server:
	sudo service grafana-server start

- Install InfluxDB on the same host
	wget http://get.influxdb.org.s3.amazonaws.com/influxdb_0.8.9_amd64.deb
	sudo dpkg -i influxdb_0.8.9_amd64.deb
- Start InfluxDB
	sudo /etc/init.d/influxdb start

- Create a New database on influxDB
	go to influxDB management page (<serverip>:8086
	log in root / root
	create database called DB01
	create user for database (non admin) with username grafana and password grafana

 - Log into Grafana (<serverip>:3000
	Set up a new data source
	Name = DB01
	Type = InfluxDB 0.8.X
	URL = 127.0.0.1:8086
	Access = Proxy
	Database = DB01
	User = grafana
	Password = grafana

 - Save and test connection

- Set up Server name files
	cd Installation
	vim ServerNames.txt - put a list of server names in here
	server names should now be individual python files.
